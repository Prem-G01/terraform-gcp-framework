  # `cleanup_policy` itself is optional (falls back to no cleanup policy
  # at all when omitted, matching GCP's own default) — found hard-required
  # with zero fallback, same class of gap as
  # docs/security.md's 2026-08-19/2026-08-24 audits found elsewhere.
  #
  # `keep_count` (set to 20/10/10 across the real dev config's docker/
  # python/maven repos) was being silently ignored entirely — only a
  # DELETE-after-30-days policy was ever created, so every operator's
  # actual "keep the last N versions" intent had zero effect. GCP's
  # provider schema requires a *separate* cleanup_policies block with
  # action = "KEEP" and a most_recent_versions { keep_count } — verified
  # directly against the installed provider schema, not assumed. Found
  # 2026-08-24.
